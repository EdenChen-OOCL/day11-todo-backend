Objective:
1. Learned about the functionality of Axios interceptors.
2. Studied the principles of CORS and how to configure it on the backend.

Reflective:
1. I am satisfied with understanding the detailed process and configuration of front-end and back-end integration.

Interpretive:
1. Through studying Axios interceptors, I understood the possible actions during request sending or response receiving, such as adding authentication information, logging, or error handling.
2. Realized the practical application of these technologies can optimize the API calling process.

Decisional:
I plan to use Axios interceptors in future projects to enhance the API handling process. Also, I can consider integrating the Spring Security framework to attempt implementing a login process.
